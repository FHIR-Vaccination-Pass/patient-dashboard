Welcome to the Patient-Dashboard of the [FHIR-Vaccination-Pass](https://github.com/FHIR-Vaccination-Pass). This is a simple react based web-application that allows patients to view and manage their vaccinations, as well as receive reminders and recommendations for their vaccination schedule. The application integrates with the [FHIR-Vaccination-Pass](https://github.com/FHIR-Vaccination-Pass) infrastructure and uses FHIR to be easily integrated into any FHIR-based system.
